## Local development

Assuming you're using a Unix-based system:

* Clone this repository and head over to the root directory.
* Make sure that you've got Python 3.10 installed in your system.
* Run `make init`. This will:
    * Create a virtual environment named `.venv` in the current directory.
    * Install the app and dev dependencies.
    * Configure pre-commit.
    * Prepare the theme for serving.
* Run `make devserver`. This will serve the contents locally.
* Go to [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) to see the site.
* The site will hot-reload whenever you make any changes to the content or the config files.


## Infrastructure

The site is built using [Pelican](https://github.com/getpelican/pelican) and hosted on Github pages. The CI automatically instantiates the build:

* Every day at 1 pm UTC.
* On every pull request.
* On every push to the master branch.

Also, [dependabot](https://github.com/dependabot/dependabot-core) is working tirelessly to keep the dependencies fresh.


## Contributions

If you've spotted an errata and want to fix it, then:

* Fork the repo and head over to the root directory.
* Create a feature branch.
* Update the relevant files in the [content](./content/*) folder. The blogs are written using GitHub flavored markdown syntax.
* Push the changes to your fork.
* Send a pull request against the `master` branch of this repo, and you're done.
