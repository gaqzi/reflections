Up until now, I've always preferred **Title Case** to demarcate the titles and section headers in my writings. However, lately I realized that each time I start writing a sentence, I waste a few seconds deciding on the correct case of the special words like—technical terms, trademark names, proper nouns, etc—and how they'd blend in with the multiple [flavors](https://capitalizemytitle.com/) of rules around title casing.

This led me to asking a [question](https://twitter.com/rednafi/status/1506949630587637762) on Twitter to find out if anyone had the same thought as mine or if it'd be ignored as trifling pedantry. The good thing is, a few people responded and they had excellent points on what they liked and disliked about title case. What surprised me that majority of them preferred **Sentence case** where you'd only capitalize the first letter of the first word of a sentence and then the capitilization of words would conform to the usual grammatical rules. So instead of this:

```
A Quick Brown Fox Jumps Over the Lazy Dog
```

you'd do this:

```
A quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog
```

This allows me not to waste those few precious seconds thinking about the rules of upper casing and whether or not sentences with technical words in them would look awkward. Also, it saves me from creating horrors like this:

Sentence case everywhere is the general trend I'm seeing on the technical blogs of some the big players on the internet:

* https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.0/
* https://dropbox.tech
* https://github.blog
* https://blog.twitter.com
* https://about.gitlab.com/blog/

One thing that I'll admit is, at first it just doesn't look right to me for a title to have sentence casing. However, I've slowly started adopting it in my writings everywhere and that begins with the transformation of this blog that you're reading. It used to conform to a mangled version of title casing to delineate the titles and sub headers but I've converted all the blogs to adopt sentence case in this PR
