## Me

Hi, I'm Redowan Delowar, and I occasionally dump my thoughts here.

Currently, I'm working as a Software Engineer at [Dendi](https://dendisoftware.com/)—an [LIMS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laboratory_information_management_system) company based in NC, US. I work with Ansible, AWS, Docker, Django, Python, and love to call myself a perpetually budding Gopher.
